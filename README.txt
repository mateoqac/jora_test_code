Before start you need to set two env variables, those are:
* TABLEBOARD_X: It represent the x axis value and it needs to be greater than 0
* TABLEBOARD_Y: It represent the y axis value and it needs to be greater than 0

After that just need to execute the command `ruby app.rb` to start the program and then you are able
to send commands one by one.
